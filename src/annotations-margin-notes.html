      <p>The United States has begun carrying out air strikes near Iraq's
      <span class="aside" data-aside="aside-haditha-dam">Haditha Dam</span>
      which was under threat from <span class="aside"
      data-aside="aside-islamic-state">Islamic State</span> (IS) fighters,
      a US defence official has said.</p>

      <p>It is the first time that the US is targeting IS fighters in the
      area as the group tries to capture the vital dam.</p>

      class="pull-left image-floated-left img-rounded">

      <p>"At the request of the Iraqi government and in keeping with our
      mission to protect US personnel and facilities, US military planes
      have begun striking ISIL terrorists near the Haditha Dam," said the
      official who declined to be identified.</p>

      <p>"These strikes are being conducted to prevent the terrorists from
      further threatening <span class="aside" data-aside="aside-iraqi-army">
      Iraqi security forces</span> in control of the dam."</p>

      <p>Iraqi army helicopters were also taking part in the offensive,
      targeting the positions of IS fighters around the city of Haditha,
      the Iraqi defence ministry confirmed."These strikes are being
      conducted to prevent the terrorists from further threatening Iraqi
      security forces in control of the dam."</p>

      <p>US officials said that while the <span class="aside"
      data-aside="aside-anbar-province">Anbar Province</span> dam remains in
      control of the Iraqis, the US offensive is an effort to beat back
      fighters who have been trying to take over key dams across the
      country.</p>

      <p>Last month, IS fighters tried to capture the Haditha Dam, which
      has six power generators located alongside the country's second-largest
      reservoir. Iraqi forces backed up by local Sunni tribes were able to
      hold them off.</p>

      <p>The IS group was able to take control of the <span class="aside"
      data-aside="aside-mosul-dam">Mosul Dam</span> in northern Iraq
      last month, but persistent US air strikes helped <span class="aside"
      data-aside="aside-kurdish">Kurdish</span> and Iraqi forces retake
      the dam.</p>

      <p>A top security spokesman told Al Jazeera that the Iraqi government
      expected the US to also conduct air strikes on areas on the outskirts
      of the capital, known as the Baghdad belt – an area particularly
      important to Iraq's security.</p>

      <p>"If we want a remedy for this cancer of course there must be
      help from the global system and if there is real help from the
      American side we will tackle it in a shorter time - especially
      when we are talking about air power. If the Americans will be
      with us in this offensive everything will be ok," the interior
      ministry spokesman told Al Jazeera.</p>

      <p>In a separate development, Kurdish <span class="aside"
      data-aside="aside-peshmerga">Peshmerga fighters</span> have
      taken Gazzer mountain, a strategic location close to Kalak on
      the road to Mosul, sources told Al Jazeera.</p>

      <p>The Peshmerga offensive was supported by air strikes from the
      Iraqi air force.</p>

        <p>The Haditha Dam (Arabic: سد حديثة‎) or Qadisiya Dam is
        an earth-fill dam on the Euphrates, north of Haditha (Iraq),
        creating Lake Qadisiyah (Arabic: Buhayrat al-Qadisiyyah‎).
        The dam is just over 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) long and 57 metres
        (187 ft) high. The purpose of the dam is to generate hydroelectricity,
        regulate the flow of the Euphrates and provide water for irrigation.
        It is the second-largest hydroelectric contributor to the power
        system in Iraq behind the Mosul Dam.</p>

      <aside id="aside-iraqi-army">
        <p>The Iraqi Army is the ground force component of the armed forces
        of the Republic of Iraq. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the
        Iraqi Army was rebuilt along American lines with enormous amounts
        of U.S. military assistance at every level. Because of the Iraqi
        insurgency that began shortly after the invasion, the Iraqi Army
        was designed to initially be a counter-insurgency force. With the
        US withdrawal in December 2011, Iraqi forces have assumed full
        responsibility for security.</p>

      <aside id="aside-anbar-province">
        <p>Al Anbar Governorate (Arabic: الأنبار‎; al-’Anbār)
        (or Anbar Province) is the largest governorate in Iraq geographically.
        Encompassing much of the country's western territory, it shares
        borders with Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Important cities in
        the province include Fallujah and Haditha. Just about all the
        inhabitants of the province are Sunni Muslims and mostly from
        the Dulaim tribe.</p>

      <aside id="aside-mosul-dam">
        <p>Mosul Dam (Arabic سد الموصل) or Chambarakat Dam, formerly known
        as Saddam Dam (Arabic,سد صدام), is the largest dam in Iraq. It is
        located on the Tigris River in the western governorate of Ninawa,
        upstream of the city of Mosul. The hydroelectric dam holds, at
        full capacity, about 11.1 cubic kilometres (2.7 cu mi) of water
        and provides electricity to the 1.7 million residents of Mosul.</p>

      <aside id="aside-kurdish">
        <p>The Kurdish people, or Kurds (Kurdish: کورد, Kurd), are an
        ethnic group in Western Asia, mostly inhabiting a region known
        as Kurdistan, which includes adjacent parts of Iran, Iraq, Syria,
        and Turkey.They are an Iranian people and speak the Kurdish
        languages, which are members of the Iranian branch of Indo-European
        languages. The Kurds have had partial autonomy in Iraqi Kurdistan
        since 1991. Nationalist movements in the other Kurdish-populated
        countries (Turkey, Syria, Iran) push for Kurdish regional autonomy
        or the creation of a sovereign state.</p>

      <aside id="aside-peshmerga">
        <p>Peshmerga or Peshmerge (Kurdish: Pêşmerge) is the term used by
        Kurds to refer to armed Kurdish fighters. Literally meaning
        "those who confront death" (Pesh front + marg death) the Peshmerga
        forces of Kurdistan have been in existence since the advent of the
        Kurdish independence movement in the early 1920s, following the
        collapse of the Ottoman and Qajar empires which had jointly ruled
        over the area. Peshmerga forces include women in their ranks. Many
        Kurds will say that all Kurds willing to fight for their rights are
        Peshmerga. The term remains in contemporary usage, sometimes written
        as pesh merga in Anglophone media.The term Peshmerga is also the
        official name of the armed forces of the Kurdistan Regional
        Government in the autonomous Kurdistan Region in Iraq.</p>
