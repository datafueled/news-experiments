      <p>When we look at a news article, we are often left with many
      questions, especially when it is a subject that we might not have
      been following closely in the past.</p>

      <p>It is not reasonable to assume that every article should be
      written to the lowest common denominator. This would lead to
      something tedious to read once you were familiar with the subject
      matter. One possible approach to solving this is to provide
      annotations as a way to indicate that additional information
      is available.</p>

      <p>Ideally, annotations would:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Not be overly intrusive or distracting.</li>
        <li>Make additional information optionally available to the
        reader when it is useful, without blocking the overall flow
        of the article.</li>
        <li>Be available and usable on all platforms.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>Looking at the <a href="annotations-none.html">sample article</a>
      that we are using for looking at the use and presentation of
      annotations, we can identify a number of open questions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Why is Haditha Dam of strategic importance?</li>
        <li>What other dams or targets are the Islamic State group going
        after?</li>
        <li>How can we read more about what happened at the Mosul dam?</li>
        <li>Who are the Peshmerga and what do they have to do with this
        story?</li>
        <li>Is this operation by the United States part of the assistance
        in the &quot;Baghdad Belt&quot; that is mentioned?</li>
        <li>Who is ISIL?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some of these questions are clear to anyone who has been following
      the story, while others may not be. The importance of the dam is
      indirectly stated later in the article after it has been asserted to
      be of strategic or vital importance a couple of times.</p>

        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
      </div>
      <p>While not yet complete with these experimental renderings,
      we are not happy with any of the approaches taken so far.</p>

      <p>Tooltips can not be interacted with. This limits their usefulness
      as you can't dig deeper and explore multiple levels of annotations.
      That said, tooltips did work well within the mobile browser
      environment.</p>

      <p>Popovers are interesting, but they also do not lend
      themselves to multiple levels of annotations. They also do not
      work well in the mobile browser environment where the screen
      may be fairly small.</p>

      <p>Margin notes could work nicely within the desktop browser
      environment. However, they do not work well in a space-constrained
      mobile environment. They also require that the margin be left
      clear so that the margin notes have somewhere to live. Many
      news websites, for better or worse, prefer to put a lot of
      additional material in the margins to draw readers to other
      reporting.</p>

      <p>Additionally, we felt that there were some other issues with
      the approach of using annotations as a whole.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The amount of text that can be given for each item
        is very limited. It must be tightly edited and restricted
        to only the most salient facts.</li>
        <li>Annotations do not handle the idea of nested or layered
        annotations very well. They are not a good entry point
        to a non-linear narrative. They are only well suited
        for very brief explanations of a term or phrase.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We feel that some aspects of this problem may be altered
      by using &quot;storylines&quot; and will pursue that avenue
      of investigation next.</p>

      <p>We will also continue to think about this problem and
      consider alternative approaches.</p>
